1. The Find Function behaved more effectively when the element was present in the array.
By looking at the graphs, the green line (not present) was higher than the red line (present) at every point.
This implies that the element not present takes longer than present for every size of the array.

2. The bin-search function behaved more effectively when the element was present in the array.
By looking at the graph, the red line (present) was momentarily higher than the green (not present) at the beginning.
This implies that the time for not present takes slightly longer than present.

3. The find time complexity is O(n) and the bin-search is Log(n). The binary search graph was spiky and difficult to observe due to the speed of evaluation, but it is possible to conclude the speed
of search for a present element in an array and non-present.
